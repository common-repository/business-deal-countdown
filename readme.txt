Let's Hurry Clients When They Are Going To Buy

== Description ==

Have you never seen a sales page where is shown a limited time offer? You can read “Get your discount now, this offer expires in 2 days…” There is also a counter that shows how much time is remaining.

With this plugin you will create on post and pages your personal time offer. You can show the countdown or not. The people can see the time offer page until the end of the time. When the time is finished the people who arrive on the page will be redirected to an other page (For instance, The time is over... this offer is ended);

* Modify the countdown, using a calendar and a clock;
